**`Software Engineer`**

Hello there! I'm Sebastian, a software engineer. It is both my hobby and proffession, as I enjoy finding and creating solutions to many types of problems. In the end, every problem is a puzzle to be solved. I've worked solo and in small groups to make wonderful projects, learning many of the tools of the craft along the way. The most important skill I developed is learning. I can pick up new coding languages, tools, and systems quickly to make a better project. My thirst for knowledge is another trait that has helped me through this journey, as I never get bored of finding new things to learn.

 <summary><h3> My Computer Journey</h3></summary>
   My love of computers stemmed from my love of games and learning. When I was 9, I wanted to get into PC gaming, and got the cheapest computer that barely ran. From there, I learned I could learn about anything on the computer. After countless hours of searching and going down wild rabbit holes, I finally asked "How do computers work?" Short answer I found it, it's really complicated. I would watch videos on people explaining what is in a computer, what code is, how to make a webstie, hacking, anything that was at all related to computers. When I entered highschool, there was an IT program. After convincing my parents that I could make a living off of computers, they let me join it. The main focus of the academy was certifications. I consistently scored above most other students until I decided I wanted to do more than just get certifications. I began learning code properly, making small projects like mini websites and console games. Python was, and still is, my favorite language. But that didn't mean I neglected other languages. Then it was off to university. Throughought my time studying and earning my bachelors, I created projects you can find on here and met two people for a group project. FS Map is our final project, and we've made a good product for a three man group with limited time. However, this final project isn't my last project. I plan to go further, learn more, develop my skillset, and become a better developer. My next goal is a master's in computer science to refine my skills even more. From there, I want to work on software that matters, software that can help people, whether it be in day to day life, or something that simply makes life easier. The sky is the limit.
Feel free to get in touch with me! See you later!
